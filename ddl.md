# Detector Description Language (DDL)
DDL provides generic XML constructs to describe materials (air, iron, etc.), shapes (or solids - box, cylinder, etc.), parts, compositions of parts, and specification of part-specific data. Table 1 lists the DDL tags available for the specification of these items. DDL further defines structuring tags to allow a granular document decomposition (listed in Table 2). Additionally, a cross document referencing mechanism allows splitting a description into multiple documents. DDL also supports named numerical constants and expressions. Together with the cross document referencing mechanism, expressions enable scalable descriptions by explicitly defining the formulas used to calculate derived quantities from base quantities.
