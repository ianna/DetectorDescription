# Introduction

The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Detector Description (DD) consists of a C++ Application Program Interface (API) and an Extensible Markup Language (XML) based detector description language.
 
The CMS Software project (CMSSW) requires that offline software for applications such as simulation, reconstruction, and visualization have a coherent common source for the geometrical properties of the detector.
 
These applications use the DD sources and API as the basis for this consistent view of the detector description. The offline applications have several common requirements, which the DD addresses in the DD Domain Model. Additionally the DD provides the ability to include application-specific information to be associated with detector parts.
